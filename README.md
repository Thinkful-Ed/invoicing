# How to Invoice

## Initial Setup


We have a global mentor team and are thankful to have found a solution in Bill.com to manage the hundreds of invoices we process every month for you folks. We require **those who both file a W-9 and are paid via a US bank account** to set up a payment account with Bill.com for tax purposes. If you fit that bill, you will have received an invite from Bill.com on the Friday or Monday after you’ve submitted your W9. Once you see the invite in your Thinkful inbox, just follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZnuI9u3PYqdV30-mqKhpIBD4oTD1knYPMsFrhVD_DQ/edit) and you’re all set!

**If you completed a W-8 tax form and/or utilize a non-US bank account,** you will also send your invoices (in PDF format) to thinkful@bill.com, but will be paid via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com) or [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com). If you do not have a Paypal or Transferwise account, take a few minutes to create one. Be sure to include the email address associated with your payment account *on the PDF invoice.* If you choose to use Transferwise, send an email to melissa@thinkful.com with the following information:
   * Currency
   * Full name of the account holder
   * Email address associated with the Transferwise account
   * IBAN
   * Address:
      * Country
      * City
      * Street address
      * Postal code

Rejoice, you’re all set! Now continue reading to learn how to create an invoice. 


## Creating your invoice

We have some standards that make invoicing simple. We request that on your invoice, you create a separate line item for each activity which includes its date, the amount owed by hours and rate, and the specific Thinkful offering, or program, it is related to. Confused…? Let’s walk through that in more detail: 

**Your work can always be categorize by one of the below buckets:**
   * EI - Mentorship
   * EI - Prep/Admin
   * EI - Other
   * Flex - Mentorship
   * Flex - Prep/Admin
   * Flex - Other
   * Data Science - Mentorship
   * Data Science - Prep/Admin
   * Data - Other
   * Skills Course - Mentorship
   * Skills Course - Prep/Admin
   * Skills Course - Other
   * Skills Course - Grading (quiz, portfolio, etc.)
   * Q&A - Data Science
   * Grading - Data Science (quiz, portfolio, etc.)
   * Q&A - EI/Flex
   * Grading - EI/Flex (quiz, portfolio, etc.)
   * Local Event

>**”Local Event” trumps everything else.** *If you lectured on a data science topic at a local event, you need to allocate that towards “Local”, and not “Data Science”.*

>*If you're unsure to which program a student belongs, check your [dashboard](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/).*

**When billing for work activities, list each activity on separate line items with the below information:**
   * Date the work occurred
   * The offering, or program, it’s allocated towards (i.e. Full Stack Flex, Engineering Immersion, Data Science, Skills Course, Local)
   * Your hourly rate for that activity
   * Quantity in hours
   * Total cost for that activity

**We recommend using this simple [invoicing template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gfjzdsenk21onny/Mentor%20Invoice%20Template%20%281%29.xlsx?dl=0).** Make sure to duplicate this so that the formulas carry over! 


## Submitting Your Invoice

**Step 1:** Manually create your invoice using our invoice template.
**Step 2:** Save your invoice as a PDF and title it with the invoice number (e.g. “Invoice #1”)
**Step 3:** Email a PDF copy of your invoice to thinkful@bill.com 

Once you send your invoice to thinkful@bill.com, it takes 1-2 days for the Bill.com team to import your invoice from the inbox to the review/approval queue. We review and approve invoices on Monday and Tuesday each week, with payments typically issued by Friday of the same week. For this reason, we typically ask that folks submit invoices by Sunday 12am ET so the invoices are in the review/approval queue by Monday/Tuesday. If there are discrepancies or clarity needed on your invoice, we will reach out to you directly for further information. Please note that when invoices are flagged as containing errors that this may delay your payment timeline.

In order to receive payment, you must submit the invoice as a **PDF attachment** to thinkful@bill.com. 


> *Helpful tip: Set a reminder on your calendar to ensure your invoices are sent before Sunday at midnight ET.*


## Frequently Asked Questions

***How many hours do I bill for going through the onboarding and the curriculum?***
You may bill up to 3 hours for completing your onboarding and reviewing the curriculum. Please pace, prioritize, and bill accordingly.

***How long does it take to get paid?***
We reserve the right to pay invoices within 2 weeks of receiving them. Bill.com predicts most transfers take 2-3 business days from the day payment is initiated, but we advise you to anticipate complete transfer within 5 business days.

***How often should I invoice?*** 
We encourage you to submit your invoices every 2-4 weeks. 

***What does “Prep & Administrative” time mean and how much of it will I be doing?***
Prep & Administrative time includes completing session records after your 1-on-1 sessions, answering emails from your students, reviewing code outside of 1-on-1 sessions, etc. We estimate no more than ~30 minutes of “administrative/prep” time per student, per week.

***Can I bill for an amount of time beyond what is expected of me?***
We're happy to approve additional support for students where it is needed, and ask that you manage your student's expectations around what extra support you are able to provide. Please raise any student requests for added support to that student's Program Manager, who can approve the amount/type of additional support needed. We encourage you to remind your student to attend Q&A sessions and leverage the student community for support as well. 

To be clear, we do reserve the right to dispute and not compensate for hours beyond the expectation set by the program if these hours were not approved and documented by a Program Manager, Format Lead, or the Ed Ops team in documented manner. If you're unsure about what activities or time are billable, please reach out in the #mentors channel in Thinkful Slack, and we'll get back to you ASAP!

***What if I make a mistake on an invoice I already submitted?***
Please do not send an updated invoice to Bill.com. If your invoice has an error on it, reach out to operations@thinkful.com to resolve the issue. 

***What is the best way to get support for a billing related question?***
Send your question to operations@thinkful.com. If you're question is regarding a specific invoice, please list the invoice number, date range, and amount.
