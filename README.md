# How to Invoice

## Initial Setup


We have a global mentor team and are thankful to have found a solution in Bill.com to manage the hundreds of invoices we process every month for you folks. We require **those who both file a W-9 and are paid via a US bank account** to set up a payment account with Bill.com for tax purposes. If you fit that bill, you will have received an invite from Bill.com on the Friday or Monday after you’ve submitted your W9. Once you see the invite in your Thinkful inbox, just follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZnuI9u3PYqdV30-mqKhpIBD4oTD1knYPMsFrhVD_DQ/edit) and you’re all set!

**If you completed a W-8 tax form and/or utilize a non-US bank account,** you will also send your invoices (in PDF format) to thinkful@bill.com, but will be paid via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com) or [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com). If you do not have a Paypal or Transferwise account, take a few minutes to create one. Be sure to include the email address associated with your payment account *on the PDF invoice.* If you choose to use Transferwise, send an email to support@thinkful.com with the following information:
   * Currency
   * Full name of the account holder
   * Email address associated with the Transferwise account
   * IBAN
   * Address:
      * Country
      * City
      * Street address
      * Postal code

Rejoice, you’re all set! Now continue reading to learn how to create an invoice. 


## Creating your invoice

We have some standards that make invoicing simple. There are 6 types of activities that you might do within Thinkful’s 5 major offerings, or programs. We request that on your invoice, you create a separate line item for each activity which includes its date, the amount owed by hours and rate, and the specific Thinkful offering, or program, it is related to. Confused…? Let’s walk through that in more detail: 

**Your work will contribute to one of Thinkful’s 5 different offerings:**
* Full Stack Flex 
    * Engineering Immersion
    * Data Science
    * Skills Course
    * Local Events (i.e. meetups and dinners)

>**”Local” trumps everything else.** *If you lectured on a data science topic at a local event, you need to allocate that towards “Local”, and not “Data Science”.*

**Additionally, within all 5 of those offerings, or programs, there are 6 specific activities you can invoice us for:**
   * 1 on 1 Sessions with “Student Name” 
   * Hosted “Name of Q&A or Workshops hosted”
   * Prep & Administrative Time for “Student Name” or “Activity”
   * Event TA’ing at “Event Name”
   * Event Speaker at “Event Name”
   * Onboarding: I’m Ready!

>*Allocate anything outside the scope of these (in practice this is nearly exclusively onboarding) as “N/A”. If your unsure to which program a student belongs, check your [dashboard](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/).*

**When billing for these 6 activities, list each activity on separate line items with the below information:**
   * Date the work occurred
   * The offering, or program, it’s allocated towards (i.e. Full Stack Flex, Engineering Immersion, Data Science, Skills Course, Local)
   * Your hourly rate for that activity
   * Quantity in hours
   * Total cost for that activity

**We recommend using this simple [invoicing template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ni6zbwru4k8fsrs/TF-invoice-template.zip?dl=0).** Make sure to duplicate this so that the formulas carry over! It has three sections:

**Section One** is simple stuff, but make sure it’s all accurate! 

**Section Two** is where you’ll provide the necessary details for each invoiced activity. 

**Section Three** is where a breakdown of costs per programs will be calculated. 

Let’s run through how to update each section of your invoice:

![invoice template](invoice_template.png)

**Section One:** Here, include your name, mailing address, and the email address associated with your PayPal or Transferwise account if you filed a W-8 and/or your bank account is outside the USA. Update the “start” and “stop” dates (the date range of when the activities took place), the invoice number, and the number of total current students reflected on the invoice. Again, please ensure it’s all accurate! 

**Section Two:** As explained in “Creating Your Invoice” above, please place each activity on a different line item and include the:  
   * Date the work occurred
   * Name of relevant student and/or the activity’s name
   * The program it’s allocated towards (Full Stack Flex, Engineering Immersion, Data Science, Skills Course, Local)
   * Your hourly rate for that activity
   * Quantity in hours
   * Total cost for that activity

>*Ensure that the “Invoice Total” row includes all the rows in Section 2 before submitting your invoice.*

**Section Three:** We need to breakdown your totals by program. Peak “under the hood” to see how the [template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ni6zbwru4k8fsrs/TF-invoice-template.zip?dl=0) uses “keywords” to automatically calculate each breakdown total for you. Remember, any in-person hours at events as a Speaker or TA should be allocated towards “Local”, regardless of the event’s topic.

Again, “Allocate Towards” column can only be tied to one of our 5 program’s “keywords”:
   * Full Stack Flex
   * Engineering Immersion
   * Data Science
   * Skills Course
   * Local
   * N/A

## Submitting Your Invoice

In order to receive payment, you must submit the invoice as a **PDF attachment** to thinkful@bill.com. 

Invoices are processed every Tuesday. Submit your invoices by midnight ET on Sunday to ensure we can initiate review and approval on Tuesday. Invoices sent after midnight ET Sunday will be processed on the following Tuesday. We pay invoices within 2 weeks of receiving them.  

Bill.com predicts most transfers take 2-3 business days from the day payment is initiated, but we advise you to anticipate complete transfer within 5 business days.

> *Helpful tip: Set a reminder on your calendar to ensure your invoices are sent before Sunday at midnight ET.*


## Frequently Asked Questions

***How many hours do I bill for going through the onboarding curriculum?***
Please take up to 3 hours to complete your onboarding, and please pace, prioritize and bill accordingly.

***How long does it take to get paid?***
We pay invoices within 2 weeks of receiving them. Bill.com predicts most transfers take 2-3 business days from the day payment is initiated, but we advise you to anticipate complete transfer within 5 business days.

***How often should I invoice?*** Please invoice every 2-4 weeks. Speak with [Derek](mailto:derek@thinkful.com) to talk out an alternative.

***What does “Prep & Administrative” time mean and how much of it will I be doing?***
Prep & Administrative time includes completing session records after your 1-on-1 sessions, answering emails from your students, reviewing code outside of 1-on-1 sessions, etc. We estimate no more than ~30 minutes of “administrative/prep” time per student, per session. 

***Can I bill for an amount of time beyond what is expected of me?***
We're more interested in successful student outcomes than extra minutes on an invoice. As long as you feel like your student is respecting your time and the communication boundaries you've set with them, you're welcome to work with them and bill us for the time. If, however, this starts to look like a different product model, where your student sees you as "on-call" or you're providing additional sessions nearly every week, let a Program Manager know immediately. Remind your student to attend Q&A sessions and leverage the student community for support as well. We do reserve the right to dispute and not compensate for hours beyond the expectation set by the program if these hours were not approved by a Program Manager or Derek in a documented manner. To be clear this circumstance is incredibly rare. We are looking for a pattern of behavior or a significant “over-delivery” of support, and not one-off decisions to ensure student success, which we love! Let us help too! 

***What if I make a mistake on an invoice I already submitted?***
Please do NOT send an updated invoice to Bill.com, instead if your invoice has an error on it, reach out to support@thinkful.com and cc derek@thinkful.com to resolve the issue. 

***What is the best way to get support for a billing related question?***
Send your question to support@thinkful.com. If you're question is regarding a specific invoice, please list the invoice number, date range, and amount.
