# How to Invoice

## Initial Setup


We have a global mentor/event staff team and are thankful to have found a solution in Bill.com to manage the hundreds of invoices we process every month for you folks. We require **those who both file a W-9 and are paid via a US bank account** to set up a payment account with Bill.com for tax purposes. If you fit that bill, you will have received an invite from Bill.com on the Friday or Monday after you’ve submitted your W9. Once you see the invite in your Thinkful inbox, just follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZnuI9u3PYqdV30-mqKhpIBD4oTD1knYPMsFrhVD_DQ/edit) and you’re all set!

**If you completed a W-8 tax form and/or utilize a non-US bank account,** you will also send your invoices (in PDF format) to thinkful@bill.com, but will be paid via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com) or [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com). If you do not have a Paypal or Transferwise account, take a few minutes to create one. Be sure to include the email address associated with your payment account *on the PDF invoice.* If you choose to use Transferwise, send an email to operations@thinkful.com with the following information:
   * Currency
   * Full name of the account holder
   * Email address associated with the Transferwise account
   * IBAN
   * Address:
      * Country
      * City
      * Street address
      * Postal code

Rejoice, you’re all set! Now continue reading to learn how to create an invoice. 


## Creating your invoice

We have some standards that make invoicing simple. We request that on your invoice, you create a separate line item for each activity which includes its date, the amount owed by hours and rate, and the specific Thinkful offering, or program, it is related to. Confused…? Let’s walk through that in more detail: 

**Your work will always be categorized by the following bucket:**
   * Local Event

**When billing for work activities, list each activity on separate line items with the below information:**
   * Date the work occurred
   * The event name or acitivity it’s allocated towards (i.e. Getting Started in Data Science workshop, 1:1 Meeting with CM)
   * Your hourly rate for that activity
   * Quantity in hours
   * Total cost for that activity

**You must use this [invoicing template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13g9qmRcqandnfvzbvpZpuKV-od-tutsr_8Xn6EiglWQ/edit#gid=238993322).** Make sure to duplicate this so that the formulas carry over! 


## Submitting Your Invoice

**Step 1:** Manually create your invoice using our invoice template.
**Step 2:** Save your invoice as a PDF and title it with the invoice number (e.g. “Invoice #1”)
**Step 3:** Email a PDF copy of your invoice to thinkful@bill.com, and if you are a local event Instructor or TA, you will cc aaron.lamphere@thinkful.com and your Community Manager.

Once you send your invoice to thinkful@bill.com, it takes 1-2 days for the Bill.com team to import your invoice from the inbox to the review/approval queue. Thinkful processes invoices sent to Bill.com twice a month: Invoices received between the 1st and 15th of the month will be paid on the last day of the month (if that day is on a holiday or weekend the payment will be moved to the business day prior). Invoices received between the 16th and last day of the month will be paid on the 15th of the next month (if the 15th is on a holiday or weekend the payment will be moved to the business day prior). 

If there are discrepancies or clarity needed on your invoice, we will reach out to you directly for further information. Please note that when invoices are flagged as containing errors that this may delay your payment timeline. Thinkful has a 90-day policy that contractors must invoice us within 90-days of the work performed for payment.

In order to receive payment, you must submit the invoice as a **PDF attachment** to thinkful@bill.com, and if you are a local event Instructor or TA, you will cc aaron.lamphere@thinkful.com and your Community Manager.


> *Helpful tip: Set a reminder on your calendar to ensure your invoices are sent before the 15th and the last day of the month at midnight ET.*
